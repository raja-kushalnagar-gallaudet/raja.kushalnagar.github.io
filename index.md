## About Me

Our BS in IT and MS in AHCC programs have grown rapidly in the past few years, and we are exploring new courses for the programs. My responsibilities include strategic planning, local industry & alumni relations, and faculty mentoring. As a researcher, I have over 12 years of experience working in accessible computing design. I primarily teach human-centered computing with a focus on accessible computing, and application development courses. I also teach cybersecurity related courses at both the introductory and specialized levels.

My research interests encompass the fields of accessible computing and accessibility/intellectual property law, with the goal of improving information access for deaf and hard of hearing individuals. In the accessible computing field, I investigate information access disparities between hearing and deaf. For example, I investigate how deaf individuals acquire information through speech-to-text, e.g., enhanced captions that provide visual cues to non-speech information.

In the accessibility/intellectual property law field, I advocate for updates in accessible and intellectual property law, to incorporate accessible computing advances such as automatic captioning/subtitling.

I have published several peer-reviewed publications and received grants in the fields of accessible computing, accessible law and intellectual property law.
